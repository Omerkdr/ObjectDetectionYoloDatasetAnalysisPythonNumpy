# Object Detection YOLO Dataset Analysis - Python NumPy

![Project Logo](logo.png)

This is a Python project that performs dataset analysis for object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. It utilizes the power of NumPy library to process and analyze the dataset.

## Installation

To use the Object Detection YOLO Dataset Analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Omerkdr/ObjectDetectionYoloDatasetAnalysisPythonNumpy.git

2. Change into the project directory:
  cd ObjectDetectionYoloDatasetAnalysisPythonNumpy
  

3. Install the required dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  

## Usage

To run the dataset analysis, execute the following command in your terminal:

python dataset_analysis.py


This will run the dataset analysis script and provide insights into the object annotations, class distribution, and other relevant statistics.
